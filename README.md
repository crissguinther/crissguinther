### Hi there stranger âœŒ

## Who am I?
My name is Criss, and I'm a programming  enthusiast, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in IT.
I've been a front-end developer for some time right now and I'm migrating to the back-end and, later, mobile. 

## What do I want to achieve?
I want to get the best out of every single study I do, and make wholesome applications with them. Currently, my main foccus language is Java, but I am also learning about Data Structures, Design Patterns and Software Structure as a whole. I also like to read and write.
