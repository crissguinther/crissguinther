### Hi there stranger ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I?
My name is Richard, and I'm a programming  enthusiast, currently studying computer science degree.
I've been a front-end developer for some time right now, but I'm actually new at this thing of git. I do know some commands, but I'm chasing to become a better developer as a whole.
You can find my profile at LinkedIn(I'm new there too), if you want to help me to achieve a new level or just to search info about me haha

## What do I want to achieve?
My focus as a developer is to change the world, as I do believe the knowledge I'm aquiring right now can be passed forward, helping people that have lost everything to find a new job and restart their lives.
I'm focusing on learning React right now as I'm pursuing a trainee oportunity here in my country.
